# My Own AI/ML/DL Learning Process

Hi, I created this repo for listing projects made in my AI/ML/DL learning process. Here it is:

## Machine learning

## Deep learning for computer vision 

### Generative model 

#### [Autoencoder: the basic, denoising and anomolies detection](https://github.com/HenrySomeCode/AE_basic_denoise_anomalies_detection.git)

#### Vrational Autoencoder

#### DCGAN - Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network
