# Introduce

Hi, this repository is for storing any things of mine related to AI/ML/DL topics. 

Currently, I have two things:

* [AI_ML_DL_Learning_Process](https://github.com/HenrySomeCode/AI_ML_DL_Learning_Process.git): This repo is for listing projects made by myself in the AI/ML/DL learning process
* [AI_ML_DL_Projects](https://github.com/HenrySomeCode/AI_ML_DL_Projects.git): I just created this repository. This would contain projects that could be more difficult and also reality than the one above
  
## What's the difference between these two repositories? 

The AI_ML_DL_Learning_Process is for projects I made mainly for learning targets, meaning the data would be 'nice.' This means I only have a few things to do with the data preprocessing, which is essential and complex in reality. 

Moreover, I made these projects to understand how the theories work in terms of coding and may unravel puzzling theories through practice.

  <p> Learning </p>
</div>


On the other hand, AI_ML_DL_projects would contain projects that will be closer to the real world. I would need to show what is the problem and why it's important to solve. Also, I will need to deal with imbalanced data or something like that related to data processing. 

Personally, I suggest that having these two kinds of projects is necessary since I can't follow a tutorial, available projects, or posts without doing exactly the same things as they do. But it's essential to have highly practical projects.

  <p> Learning vs. Reality </p>

Also, in AI_ML_DL_projects, I need to show how good the model is through metrics like accuracy, F1 score, AUC, mAP, Etc. Besides, I could need to point out the pros, cons, and ways to improve the project as well.
